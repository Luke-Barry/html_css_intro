        <p>Butter chicken, also known as Murgh Makhani in Hindi, is a beloved Indian dish that has a relatively recent but fascinating history. It is said to have originated in the 1950s in the kitchens of the famous Moti Mahal restaurant in Delhi, India. Legend has it that the dish was created by the restaurant's founders, Kundan Lal Gujral and Kundan Lal Jaggi, as a way to make use of leftover tandoori chicken by simmering it in a rich and creamy tomato gravy. The result was a delightful combination of tender, smoky chicken and a luscious, tomato-based sauce enriched with butter and cream. Butter chicken quickly gained popularity in India and eventually made its way to international menus, becoming one of the most beloved and iconic dishes of Indian cuisine worldwide. Its rich, indulgent flavors and creamy texture continue to captivate taste buds and make it a quintessential part of Indian culinary culture.</p>
