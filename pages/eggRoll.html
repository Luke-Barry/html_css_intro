        <p class="small-para">Egg rolls, a staple of Chinese and Asian cuisine, have a history that spans centuries. Originating in China, these savory snacks are believed to have evolved from the spring roll, a traditional Chinese dish. Egg rolls, as we know them today, likely originated in the southern regions of China, where they were made with thin wheat wrappers and filled with a mixture of vegetables, meat, and sometimes seafood. These delicious treats made their way to the United States with Chinese immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the U.S., egg rolls gained popularity and underwent further adaptations, with variations in fillings and cooking methods. Today, egg rolls are enjoyed not only in Chinese-American cuisine but also in various Asian and international culinary contexts, making them a cherished and globally recognized snack or appetizer.</p>
